Pomelo Project
---

This is where we will host our project for collaboration.

There is a simple process for getting started on the project. We have already installed node and gulp, so it shouldn't be too difficult.

- open Terminal and type `cd ` with a space
- drag-and-drop the file located in wp-content/themes called gulp to Terminal
- press enter to navigate to the selected folder
- inside of Terminal, type `npm install` to install the gulp project
- in Terminal type `gulp watch` to start watching your scss and js files
- now every save should compile the Sass (.scss) file automatically

Hopefully this will work without an issue...
